little insight on the release
i thought not many people release working injectors these days that can actually inject past EAC and other anti-cheats i want to be able to provide a working injector for upcoming cheat developers or just individual people who dont understand code and want to cheat on a anti-cheat protected game.

why not release injector source and driver source?
because i dont agree with the fact of many people skidding on developers work in this category ( fair enough for cheats ) but injectors and drivers are more important to keep private although i will sell this source code for a reasonable price.

WHAT ARE THE BENIFITS THAT COME WITH BUYING PRIVATE SOURCE CODE?
the source code is not public version it will be a completely undetected injector + driver along with a custom mapper allowing you to bypass vangaurd + faceit blocking methods

UI Mode ( imgui mode of the injector )

dump games + the game pdb ( some games dont work )

you can use detours + minhook

choose what injection format you want x86 / x64

IAT dumper

cheat engine support + other debuggers

offset dumper ( UnrealEngine only )

Dump EAC + BE

edit packets / spoof packets

inject without any detections / trace

Anti-Cheat Emulator ( allowing you to play without running anti-cheat )

have a full private source code ( fully undetected + Secure source code )
